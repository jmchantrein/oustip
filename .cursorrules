# Cursor Rules for OustIP
# Generated by .ai/generate.sh

## Project Context

You are working on OustIP, an IP Blocklist Manager for Linux Gateways written in Rust.

## First Action

Always read `.ai/MEMORY.md` first for project context and past decisions.

## Key Rules

1. **Security First**: Validate all inputs, no unwrap() without justification
2. **Spec-Driven**: Understand specifications before implementing
3. **Quality**: Run cargo fmt, clippy, and tests before committing
4. **Bilingual**: Documentation in EN (primary) and FR (mirror)
5. **Inclusive**: Use inclusive writing in French (point median)

## Code Style

- Rust edition 2021, minimum version 1.75
- Use Result/? for error handling, not unwrap()
- Prefer &str over String where possible
- Document with /// not //

## Commands

```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

## Files to Reference

- AGENTS.md - Complete rules
- .ai/MEMORY.md - Context and decisions
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical architecture

## Never

- Use shell=true for command execution
- Log secrets or credentials
- Ignore security warnings
- Push to main without review
